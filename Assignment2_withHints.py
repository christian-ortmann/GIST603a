# TODO Q1: Your Grade
#   In this question, you will print a letter grade based on your expected final score (out of 250) in this class.
#   (a) Create a variable to store your expected final score as an integer and print its contents.
#   (b) Create a new variable to store the percentage of your final score using the variable from (a) and by dividing
#   it by 250 and multiplying the result by 100. Print its contents.
#   (c) Write if, elif and/or else statements to check for all of the following conditions and perform the necessary
#   actions as stated below.
#           (i) If your percentage is greater than or equal to 90%, print <bol>Final Grade: A<eol>
#           (ii) If your percentage is greater than or equal to 80% and less than 90%, print <bol>Final Grade: B<eol>
#           (iii) If your percentage is greater than or equal to 70% and less than 80%, print <bol>Final Grade: C<eol>
#           (iv) If your percentage is greater than or equal to 60% and less than 70%, print <bol>Final Grade: D<eol>
#           (v) If your percentage is less than 60%, print <bol>Final Grade: E<eol>
#   (d) Test your code by running your code block for each of the following final scores: 64, 151, 189, 200, 249
#       You can do this by changing the value of the variable from (a) and running the code block multiple times.
#       Ensure that your code handles all test cases correctly.
#   Note: <bol> indicates "beginning of line", and <eol> indicates end of line. These are indicative of where
#   the line starts and where it ends. You do not have to print <bol> & <eol> in the output.
